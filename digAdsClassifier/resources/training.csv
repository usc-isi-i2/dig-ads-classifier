It is administered by ""laying on hands"" and is based on the idea that an unseen ""life force energy"" flows through us and is what causes us to be alive.

4,"          In 2002, DATE CHECK launched the Internet's first adult entertainment screening and verification system where you can check references 24-7, at your convenience.  It is used by thousands of members throughout North America.  DATE CHECK verification offers members an efficient and discreet means of screening each other before meeting.   DATE CHECK is a long time, trusted, and respected service.  Female owned-operated by those with first-hand knowledge of the industry, discretion is paramount to us!  We value our members and make every effort to earn their trust.       Reputable           We are the original, often emulated but never duplicated, nationwide screening and verification service since 2002. We are so trusted that personal booking services use DATE CHECK verification as a part of their screening process.  Not to mention that even services that try to compete with DATE CHECK ask their new applicants if they are a DATE CHECK verified member.     Responsive   Our industry-experienced team is available Monday through Friday, from 9am to 5pm EST by email, phone, and live chat.  Saturday and Sunday is via email.  Most inquiries are addressed immediately, and otherwise within 1 business day.       Quality   We don't approve just any entertainer or agency, they must pass and maintain our high level of standards.  Only the most reputable agencies and independent entertainers are approved.       For the clients, we employ an in-depth, non-invasive discreet screening process that insures that only reputable clients are receiving memberships on DATE CHECK.       Discretion   Is paramount with us.  We do not share or keep any personal information about you in our database.  You have full control of any personal preferences that you wish to share in your profile.  We are the originator of the discreet and non-identifying member ID.       Coverage   Our memberships span virtually every state in the US, Canada and some International countries.  This is important when you travel, or when others travel to your area.   Back to Top       DATE CHECK has been a trusted resource for screening since 2002.  Using DATE CHECK in your screening process will maximize efficiency and minimize logistical headaches.  Many dates are scheduled with little advance notice.  If references or screening information cannot be quickly verified, both the client and entertainer will inevitably miss meeting each other that day.  DATE CHECK allows an entertainer to access a clients dating history via their references, as well as the view the potential clients preferences and physical description.  Entertainers can also see additional contact references on a clients profile providing additional information.         Almost every adult entertainer screens potential clients before meeting them.  Screening is a time intensive process that requires the clients full name and employment information, as well as the names and contact information for references (i.e. other entertainers whom the client has met in the past).      Most people are not comfortable providing this information to every entertainer they meet.  Alternatively, the client may not have recent references, or even any at all.   In addition, clients who take advantage of DATE CHECK have the opportunity to share their profile with any details they feel comfortable including.  As a client, you have full control of your profile, and can view hundreds of entertainer profiles.      Upon applying, the potential DATE CHECK client will be required to verify the email address they provided upon registering.  Should the client not have access to this address, they will be unable to receive the link to the official application forms.  Once a client has been verified and approved, DATE CHECK assigns them a unique username for identification.  Sharing your ID with anyone is grounds for termination of membership.      Following a date, the client logs in to DATE CHECK, opens the entertainer's profile, and clicks on the ""We Have Met"" button.  An email template appears, in which the client provides discreet memory-jogging information to remind the entertainer of their previous meeting.  Subsequently an email is sent to the entertainer, requesting her reference for the client.  The entertainer then approves or declines the request and an email indicating the response is sent to the client requestor.  It is important to note that the entertainer can also initiate verification for the client following their meeting.  She can do this by logging in, looking up the clients profile, and then selecting the reference approval option in his profile.           Simply fill out our application here...   JOIN NOW         Yes, you can still become a member.  You will receive all the features that the other entertainers receive, except that you will not have a profile.    Back to Top       Yes, non-members may still advertise;  however, please note some advertising packages are for members only.  Please contact us directly to discuss your options and needs.    Back to Top     For those clients without references or those whose membership has finished, the cost is $99 for a one-year subscription.  However, in the very near future, the cost will be increasing to $124 as we will be launching our new site with many more exciting features.  We highly recommend taking advantage of our low membership opportunity now!     Independent Entertainer & Agency memberships vary according to individual advertising needs.  Please contact us for more information.     Verification Only Membership for three-months is $85, six-months is $150, and one-year is $250.          Back to Top     DATE CHECK statement and disclaimer ...   Please remember, this is a crazy world. DATE CHECK is for entertainment   purposes only. DATE CHECK cannot and will not guarantee the safety of any   member. DATE CHECK is simply an online community database consisting of   entertainers and entertainers who state that they have met.

4,"The trade association for the pleasure products and adult entertainment industry Adult Film Performers Call on Weinstein to Pull Flawed Ballot Initiative  Free Speech Coalition   LOS ANGELES  Adult film performers have requested that Michael Weinstein, the proponent of a controversial ballot initiative that would allow private citizens to sue adult film performers when a condom is not visible in an adult film, pull the initiative ahead of crucial June 30 deadline.   Performers, led by Chanel Preston, President of the Adult Performer Advocacy Committee are requesting a public meeting with Michael Weinstein on Tuesday, June 28th, at 12PM, at the Andaz West Hollywood. Members of the press are invited to attend, though performers reserve the right to conduct some discussions privately, if it will be more productive.   The open letter to Weinstein, and information about the meeting is below:      Mr. Michael Weinstein    FAIR4CA    6255 Sunset Blvd    Los Angeles CA 90028   Mr. Weinstein,   As the sole proponent and funder of the Safer Sex in Adult Film Act, we are calling on you to pull this dangerous initiative from the November ballot by the deadline of June 30, before any performers are harmed. We ask that you personally meet with us on Tuesday, June 28th, to discuss a way forward. You have repeatedly stated that you want the best for adult film performers, however the largest performer-led organization, Adult Performer Advocacy Committee (APAC) is opposed to this initiative.   We call on you to remove the ballot initiative and work with us directly on regulations for the following reasons:   This month, Cal/OSHA announced it will convene a working group including performers and performer groups on new regulations to protect performers, beginning this summer. These talks represent a first for Cal/OSHA, and a chance to finally have our voices heard on regulations that affect us.    Both the major political parties in California, Republican and Democrat, representing over 13 million voters, have officially opposed this measure, given the threat it poses to performers safety and privacy. They have been joined by major HIV/AIDS groups, including SF AIDS Foundation and AIDS Project LA.    Your own representatives have admitted that the initiative will allow performers to be sued personally when a condom is not visible. This poorly drafted provision will lead to profiteering, harassment, privacy violations and outright physical danger to thousands of adult performers.    Last year, the California Legislature passed SB 1253 (Steinberg) for situations just like this. An initiative containing so many flaws, and an issue being addressed by a state entity is reasonable justification to withdraw the initiative from the November ballot.   The provision allows a proponent to pull the initiative no later than 130 days before the general statewide election, in this case, June 30.   As the largest performer organization in the industry, we call on you personally to meet with us at:   Andaz West Hollywood    Studio 1    8401 Sunset Blvd.    West Hollywood, CA   We hope to have an honest public discussion, to find commonality, and to explain why the initiative, as written, is so dangerous to performer health and safety. As the sole proponent of this measure, we ask that you  not a surrogate  attend the meeting, as you are the only one able to remove it by the June 30 deadline.   We will be at the Andaz on June 28th at noon , and hoping to see you there.
